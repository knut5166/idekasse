Examples and notes

noticed some things about the pigpio on latest Raspbian Jessie ca 2016-05-01

LH i2c on weather-head works now.
Seems to be 2mm shafts both main and secondary on the unnamed hour-counter devices from EPO, 5 black and 1 white decade wheel per. 
Plus 1:45 worm drive, 1:20 geneva-variant, and 10:48 fine-pitch from synchronous motor.
